              Brimstone began to take shape when the junior class of the illustration department started the Mask Project. <br>
              We were sent to the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art to look for inspiration. I ended up in the Native American exhibit, <br>
              and this mask in particular struck me. I enjoyed drawing it so much that it became the root of inspiration for my <br>
              mask project.

                 The design stage of the Mask Project began. I needed to design a mask that expressed "schadenfreude." So I <br>
                 began to sketch. This is where the mask design started to turn into a character. Because once the mask was designed,<br>
                 I wanted to design the outfit to wear with it, too. And once I drew the outfit, I wanted to doodle the character  <br>
                 and build a world around her. By the end of the project, Brimstone was a full-fledged character and the worldbuilding <br>
                 was just beginning...

                  Once Brimstone became a concrete concept, I drew her all the time. It was during this period of consistently <br>
                  sketching her that the story started to naturally develop. Most of it was vague &#40;post-apocalyptic, religious themes, <br>
                  plot points revolving around dealing with grief&#41;, but the best part of this era was the concept art. I drew Brimstone <br>
                  in many different mediums, trying out both loose and detailed expressions of her character. <br>

                    Eventually, I wanted to develop Brimstone into something more than just drawings. At the time, I had recently played <br>
                    a cult classic game called <em>OFF</em>. The game was made by a single person in an old, pixel graphics RPG engine, <br>
                    no coding required. It single-handedly inspired me to turn Brimstone into a video game, even though I had never done <br>
                    anything like it before. Over the next two years, I worked a lot in RPG Maker 2003 &#40;the exact engine that was <br>
                    used to make <em>OFF</em>&#41; and Brimstone went through several artistic iterations in pixel form. <br>
